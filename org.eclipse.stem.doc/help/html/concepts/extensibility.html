<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>
STEM was designed from the very beginning to be easily extended.  This means
that it is possible to add new data and compuatational components to STEM
and use them in new modeling approaches not explicitly provided in the 
base configuration of the system.  The choice of Eclipse as the implementation 
framework allows STEM to leverage the framework's software component architecture to
facillitate this.
