<h2>
What is the Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler (STEM)?
</h2>
<p>
The Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler (STEM) tool is designed 
to help scientists and public health officials create and use spatial 
and temporal models of emerging infectious diseases. 
These models could aid in understanding, and potentially preventing, 
the spread such diseases.
</p>
<p>
Policymakers responsible for creating strategies to contain diseases 
and prevent epidemics need an accurate understanding of disease 
dynamics and the likely outcomes of preventive actions. 
In an increasingly connected world with extremely efficient 
global transportation links, the vectors of infection can 
be quite complex. STEM facilitates the development of advanced 
mathematical models that incorporate many factors that impact 
the spread of disease.  These include population types and their 
geographical distribution and density, transportation routes and 
their capacities, and the characteristics of a disease.
