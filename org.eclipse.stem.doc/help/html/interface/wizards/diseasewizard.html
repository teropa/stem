<body>
<p>The <em>New Disease Wizard</em> is used to create and define the
properties of a new Disease. A file name for the new instance along with the Disease Name must be provided.</p>
<p>Parameters that can be specified depends upon the particular disease model selected in the Disease Model drop-down. 
For example, for an SI model, the parameters are:
<ul>
	<li>Disease Name</li>
	<li>Population: i.e., human</li>
	<li>Time Period (TP): In milliseconds, the reference time period all rates are in relation to.</li>
	<li>Frequency Dependent: Yes or No. If No, the disease model assumes density dependency and transmission rates are scaled according to the local population density.</li>
	<li>Reference Pop Density: PM/SQ KM. The reference density, only used when frequency dependent is No</li>
	<li>Transmission Rate (&Beta;).  The transmission rate of the disease</li> 
	<li>Non-Linearity Coefficient: Must be greater than or equal to 0.0. Incidence is (&Beta)*S*I^exp </li>
	<li>Infectious Recovery Rate (&gamma;): PM/TP*</li>
	<li>Infectious Mortality Rate (&mu; &iota;): PM/TP*</li>
	<li>Characteristic Mixing Distance: In kilometers, the distance threshold where the population is assumed fully mixed.</li>
	<li>Road.Net.Inf.Proportion: Fraction per Road</li>
</ul></p>
