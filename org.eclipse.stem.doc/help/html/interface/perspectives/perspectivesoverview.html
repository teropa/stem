<h1>Perspectives</h1>
<p>
STEM is an Eclipse Rich Client application. As such it is organized into
&quot;perspectives&quot; each of which contains one or more
<a href="../views/viewsoverview.html">views</a>. <br>
The contents of a perspective can be customized by the user but the default
perspectives are designed to support different uses of the STEM application.<p>
The STEM system contains three "perspectives":
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="analysis.html">Analysis</a> perspective is use to analyze
	epidemic data&nbsp; gathered from completed simulations or from import
	public health reports. It also supports comparison and validation of
	multiple data sets.</li>
	
	<li>The <a href="designer.html"> Designer</a> perspective is used
	to design and create new STEM Simulations.</li>
	
	<li>The <a href="simulation.html"> Simulation</a> perspective is
	used to start,&nbsp; view, and control running STEM Simulations.</li>

</ul>
