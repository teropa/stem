<h1>Analysis Perspective</h1>
<p>The <em>Analysis and Validation 
Perspective</em> allows users to perform analysis, fitting, model comparison, and 
validation across multiple simulations and data sets. The Analysis perspective 
uses data from either complete simulation runs or data imported into STEM. The latter 
could be real bio-surveillance data in the appropriate CSV format or data from a 
completed simulation. </span>
<p>The purpose of this perspective is to hold the windows (and associated tools) that 
support various analysis operations on existing data. If the perspective is not 
visible once you start STEM, just go to the menu bar and click:<br>
<br>
&gt;Window&gt;Open Perspective&gt;Analysis<p>
By default, the Analysis perspective contains three views. </span>&nbsp;However you can close any of these views and open others.
<h3>Default Views</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Tabbed Views</b>: The tabbed view holds the following views.</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../views/Estimatorview.html">Estimator View</a>: Used to 
		estimate model parameters from an existing data set (simulated or real).<li>
		<a href="../views/ScenarioComparisonview.html">Scenario Comparison View</a>: 
		Measures the RMS difference between two existing data sets (simulated or 
		real).<li><a href="../views/Lyapunovview.html">Lyapunov View</a>: 
		Compares two existing scenarios based on their trajectories in a 
		Lyapunov Phase Space.<li><a href="../views/Epidemicview.html">
		Epidemic View</a>: Aggregates data across locations for a given epidemic 
		scenario and plots the aggregated data and disease incidence.</ul>
