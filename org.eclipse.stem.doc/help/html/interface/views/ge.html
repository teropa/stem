<h1>STEM to GoogleEarth View</h1>
<p>The STEM to GoogleEarth view projects the results of the STEM
simulation onto GoogleEarths 3D display of the World. For example, in
the following display, the progress of a disease is shown in red
superimposed on the GoogleEarth display.</p>
<p>
<ul>
	Color Key
	<li>Blue - Susceptible</li>
	<li>Yellow - Exposed</li>
	<li>Red - Infectious</li>
	<li>Green - Recovered</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/gemap1.jpg" width=600>
<p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You must have installed the GoogleEarth application which is
available for personal use from the <a
	href="http://earth.google.com/earth4.html">GoogleEarth download
site</a>. You should verify that GoogleEarth works correctly on your machine
by starting it and verifing that you can browse the 3D image. 
Plus it is a fun application to play with. Note that some older
computers do not have the 3D graphics capabilities required by
GoogleEarth and you will not be able to run GoogleEarth.   
<h2>Starting the STEM to GoogleEarth interface.</h2>
<p>You can leave GoogleEarth running or not. STEM will start it if
needed. 
<p>
If you are running STEM from the source distribution,  you need build the 
Servlets as described later.  
<ul>
    <li>Startup the STEM application as described earlier.
	<li>Load GoogleEarth View <b>Windows->GoogleEarth View</b>
	<li>Select the GoogleEarth View from the Tabbed Window. <br>
	This should start the GoogleEarth application if it was not
	already started. The STEM-GoogleEarth interface has many options that
	can be set from 
	<b>Windows->preferences->STEM->Visualization->Geographic->GoogleEarth</b> 
	However, we can use the defaults for our first run. 
	<li>Start a new simulation by selecting the Scenario window. 
	<li>Select the USA scenario. STEM->Geography->Political->Country->USA
	<li>double clicking the "Spanish Flu" <a href="../../concepts/modelingframework.html#scenario"> Scenario</a>.
	<li>After the display has run for at laeast 7 cycles, 
	    press the <b>pause</b> control.
	<li>Select the GoogleEarth View and press the <b>Display</b> button.
	<li>You should see the current state of the Spanish Flu infection superimposed on 
	    the GoogleEarth map.
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Manual mode versus Automatic Mode.</h2>
  The STEM to GoogleEarth is distributed with the default to run in Manual mode.
  In order to see the state of the disease superimposed on the 
  GoogleEarth 3D image, you have to manually press the display button.
  The more interesting way to run it is with the GoogleEarth display 
  being automatically updated on each cycle with the current status of the disease.
  But because both STEM and GoogleEarth use a lot of CPU resources and 
  system memory, they will only run well simultaneously if you have at least 
  two Gigabytes of memory and a fast processor.  It will run with one gigabyte 
  of memory but very slowly.
  <p>
  If you are lucky enough to have 2 Gigabytes memory, go to the 
  <a href="../preferences/preferencesgetoplevel.html">GoogleEarth Preferences</a>
  and set the "method" preference to "Asynch Servlet" or "Direct Launch".
  <p>
  The next time you start a simulation, you should then see the disease spread 
  in the GoogleEarth window as STEM runs.
  <p>
  You can also <b>right click</b> in the STEM-GoogleEarth window to bring up 
  a context menu with additional commands.
  
  <h2>Building Servlets</h2>
  If you are running from the STEM source distribution:
  <ul>
    <li>Update STEM to the latest code level and ensure it is refreshed and rebuilt.
    <li>From project <b>org.eclipse.stem.ui.ge</b> select <b>servlet.xml</b>
    <li>Select <b>RunAs->AntBuild</b>
    <li>From Eclipse, Run Stem using stem.product in org.eclipse.stem.ui 
        as described earlier 
   </ul>
  If you are running the STEM standalone executable, the above steps were 
  already done for you and you just need to start STEM.exe.
  
  <h2>Context Menu</h2>
  If you bring up the context menu (Right click in Windows) then you will 
  get a menu where you can issue some control commands or options for the 
  STEM/GoogleEarth interface.  The difference between the context menu and 
  the <b>Prefereces</b> is that the context menu only affects the current 
  invocation.  
  <ul>
   <li><em>Display Admin Area</em><br>
     This will bring up a menu where you can specify an admin area and 
     have if displayed on the GoogleEarth map.  This has nothing to do 
     with STEM but it was useful during our develpment of the STEM 
     geography files and has been left in.
   <li><em>Display Status</em><br>
     This will display on the console the status of the STEM/GoogleEarth 
     internal interface.  It is a useful debug tool.
   <li><em>Debug On/Off</em><br>
     Turns on  or off the debug output.
   <li><em>GoogleEarth Start</em><br>
     Startup GoogleEarth application if it is not already started.
   <li><em>GoogleEarth Restart</em><br>
     If GoogleEarth was for any reason stopped or crashed, 
     this will attempt to get it running again with the current 
     STEM status. It may not work.
   <li><em>GoogleEarth Run</em><br>
     This is used if you have already captured the KML log files and 
     you want to run them after the simulation is complete.
     It will let you specify the folder containing the KML files and 
     will send them one by one to GoogleEarth.
   <li><em>GoogleEarth Stop</em><br>
     This will stop the sending of files to GoogleEarth and 
     clear the polygons already displayed. 
   
  </ul>
