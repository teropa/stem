<h1>Epidemic View</h1>
<p>The <em>Epidemic View</em> displays a dynamic collection of
"simulation controls" that match the set of "active" Simulations. Each
control shows the name of the Scenario and that status of the
Simulation, including its "state" (either "Running" or "Paused"), the
current "time" in the simulation, a progress bar. Each control also has
five buttons that control the corresponding Simulation:
<ol>
	<li>"Run" Begin running the Simulation.</li>
	<li>"Pause" Pause the running of the Simulation. This maintains
	the current state of the simulation.</li>
	<li>"Reset" Reset all state information in the Simulation back to
	initial values and set the state of the Simulation to "Paused"</li>
	<li>"Step" Run the simulation for a single cycle and then set the
	state of the Simulation to "Paused"</li>
	<li>"Stop" Stop all execution of the Simulation and destroy all
	state information. The Simulation will be removed from the system.</li>
</ol>
</p>
&nbsp;<p>To use the Epidemic view:<ol>
	<li>Enter the <a href="../perspectives/analysis.html">Analysis Perspective</a></li>
	<li>Click on the Epidemic Tab</li>
	<li>Use the Select Folder button to chose the folder containing the epidemic data 
	you wish to study. The files should have the following
	<a href="csvloggerview.html">&nbsp;format.</a></li>
	<li>Click Aggregate Data. This will automatically create two aggregated data 
	files based on the data in the original scenario folder. These file names 
	will appear in the<br>
	text fields for Scenario Aggregate File and Scenario Incidence file.&nbsp; 
	The aggregated data will be written to the 'aggregate' and 'incidence' 
	subfolders respectively <br>
	(these will be created if they do not exist). The files will be named based 
	on the input scenario folder. The aggregate data is the running integral or 
	sum over time <br>
	of all compartment data (S,E,I,R) over all locations in the input scenario 
	folder. The incidence data contains differential data including incidence 
	(new cases at time t), <br>
	new births, deaths, etc. Incidence data will be estimated if it does not 
	exist in the original scenario data files. Note, if you already have 
	aggregate data you can also input<br>
	these files manually.</li>
	<li>On the left hand side the Epidemic view will show the integrated state 
	data (S,E,I,R, etc). Differential data will appear on the right hand chart. 
	To toggle between linear<br>
	and logarithmic scales or to change what variables are plotted just right 
	click and use the custom dialog that will appear. </li>
