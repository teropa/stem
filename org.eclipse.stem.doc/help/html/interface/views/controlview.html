<h1>Control View</h1>
<p>The <em>Control View</em> displays a dynamic collection of
"simulation controls" that match the set of "active" Simulations. Each
control shows the name of the Scenario and that status of the
Simulation, including its "state" (either "Running" or "Paused"), the
current "time" in the simulation, a progress bar. Each control also has
five buttons that control the corresponding Simulation:
<ol>
	<li>"Run" Begin running the Simulation.</li>
	<li>"Pause" Pause the running of the Simulation. This maintains
	the current state of the simulation.</li>
	<li>"Reset" Reset all state information in the Simulation back to
	initial values and set the state of the Simulation to "Paused"</li>
	<li>"Step" Run the simulation for a single cycle and then set the
	state of the Simulation to "Paused"</li>
	<li>"Stop" Stop all execution of the Simulation and destroy all
	state information. The Simulation will be removed from the system.</li>
</ol>
