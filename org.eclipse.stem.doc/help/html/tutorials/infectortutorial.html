<p>Click on the new infector icon (black square with the health symbol and 
the letter I) </p>
<ol>
	<li>Name it (e.g., &quot;CubaInfector&quot;), under DiseaseName: &quot;ExperimentalDisease&quot;
	<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Under country select the location you want to infect (e.g.,&nbsp; Cuba). 
	You can infect at the country level, state or province level or even at the 
	county level depending on the resolution of the graph you are using. In the 
	case of Cuba, only country level is selected (see Figure 2.)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Click on the Scenario to open it in the Resource set <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>drag the CubaInfector from Decorators into the <b>Scenario</b> (open it to see 
it) <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the resource set click on the infector SI Infector ExperimentalDisease to edit 
it. Your disease model may be SI, SIR, SIER, etc but in all cases you only need 
an SI infector (as this base class will add infectious people to seed any model.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Click on Properties to open the Properties Editor and double click on 
	the Infector in the Resource Set under your scenario. This will open an 
	editor where you can confirm the location to be infected and the number of 
	infectious people to start with.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add additional infectors for other locations as desired following the 
	procedure above.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
