<h1>Creating a new Sequencer Tutorial</h1>
<p>Every scenario must also include a &quot;sequencer&quot; which basically is a clock 
that<br>
regulates time, and an &quot;infector&quot; which sets the initial infectious population. 
Stem has a build in default<br>
sequencer called the &quot;Sequential Sequencer&quot; but you will no doubt want to create 
your own to specify<br>
start time, step size, end time, etc.</p>
<p>To create a new sequencer click on the New Sequencer Icon which appears as a 
little clock.<br>
Alternatively, on the menu bar you can select &gt;NEW&gt;SEQUENCER</p>
<table border="1" width="16%" id="table1">

		<img border="0" src="img/sequencer3.jpg" width="58" height="56"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="center"><b>Figure 1: The New Sequencer Icon</b></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &quot;New Sequential Sequencer&quot; Dialog will open as shown in figure 2 below.<br>
Specify in which Project to put the Sequencer (it will always go in your 
Sequencers folder).<br>
Give it a name, and select the cycle period and unit. At this point in time STEM 
only supports<br>
constant time steps. In the future new Sequencers will be created that allow 
variable time steps.</p>
<p>Select the starting date.</p>
<p>If you wish to specify and End Date be sure to check the <b>&quot;Specify End 
Date&quot; </b>checkbox.<br>
This check box MUST be set for the end date to be editable later.</p>
<p>You will then be allowed to set the End Date in the second calendar. <br>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="center"><b>Figure 2: The New Sequential Sequencer Dialog 
		helps you configure a Sequencer.</b></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have created your sequencer it must be dragged into your scenario 
folder. Follow the instructions<br>
under <a href="scenariotutorial.html">&quot;Creating a Scenario&quot;. </a>&nbsp;The 
sequencer can be edited after creation by opening the scenario, selecting the
<br>
sequencer, and double clicking to open it in the &quot;property editor&quot; at the bottom 
of the screen (See figure 3).</p>
