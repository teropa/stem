<h1>Create a new Project</h1>

<p>

<b>Step 1: Creation of a new Project.</b><br>
This tutorial tells you how to create a project in the STEM Designer 
perspective. A project is really a new Folder in you<br>
your STEM workspace. You never need to access these folders or STEM design files 
outside of the STEM environment but they
are all stored in the folder <br>
...\runtime-stem.product <br>
which is located in the 
same folder as your STEM workspace (e.g. c:\runtime-stem.product).<p>
The names used to create a Test project in this example are in parentheses. 
<br>
Substitute your names as appropriate. 
In this example, the scenario will be for Japan.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> There are icons for many of the actions but for clarity here 
the menubar items are used.<br>
The new project Icon is shown in Figure 1.<br>

	</tr>

<h3>Creating the Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run STEM. You should see a TAB with the label &quot;Designer&quot; on it. This is the 
Designer Perspective used to design projects, Scenarios, etc. Another 
perspective is the STEM Perspective used when you actually run a mode. If for 
some reason the Designer Perspective has been closed or is not visible. Go to 
the menu bar and click:<br>
&gt;window&gt;open perspective...&gt;Designer<br>
to open it. Go to the STEM Designer Perspective. <br>
&nbsp;<li>Click on New->STEM project and create new STEM project (Test)
<li>Click "Next" if you want to update the DublinCore data.
<li>Click "Finish"
<li> Open the new project. You should see several folders including: decorators, graphs, etc.
</ul>
