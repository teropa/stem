<h1>Create a new Scenario</h1>
<font size="4">
</font> 
<p>click on the purple diamond icon to create new scenario </p>
<p>give it a name (you might want more than one so index it, for example, as 
&quot;ExperimentalDisease1&quot;) </p>
<p>Fill in any Dublin core data you want to add </p>
<p>click finish </p>
<p>From the Project Explorer window, under Models, Drag the new model 
(&quot;cuba.model&quot;) into the new Scenario in the Resource Set. Expand the scenario so 
you can see that it worked. </p>

<p align="left">Your model is now part of your scenario but you are not finished 
yet. Every scenario must also include a &quot;sequencer&quot; which basically is a clock 
that<br>
regulates time, and an &quot;infector&quot; which sets the initial infectious population. 
If you ran a model for an infectious disease where nobody was infected anywhere 
then<br>
nothing would happen. Please follow the separate tutorials on &quot;<a href="sequencertutorial.html">creating 
a sequencer</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="infectortutorial.html">creating and infector</a>&quot; 
to learn more about how to create and customize<br>
each of them. In the example below we will describe creation of a scenario using 
a default sequencer but you can easily use your own custom sequence simply<br>
by dragging that from&nbsp; your projects &quot;sequencers&quot; folder.</p>
<p align="left"><br>
<b>Add a sequencer to the Scenario</b><br>
<br>
To add the system default sequencer to your model, go to Sequencers on the 
bottom window - expand fully<br>
<br>
drag &quot;Sequential Sequencer 2006&quot; into the Scenario in the Resource Set. Make 
sure you have a properties Editor Window open<br>
<br>
click on &gt;Window&gt;other&gt;General&gt;Properties to open the properties view. Open the 
Disease in the Properties Editor &#8211; get ready to Create an Infector<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Adding an Infector<br>
</b><i>See also the instructions for <a href="infectortutorial.html">creating an 
infector.</a></i><br>
To create an infector you first need to make sure you know the exact &#8216;Disease 
Name&#8217; used when you created your disease. <br>
To be sure check it as follows. In the Project Explorer, Under Decorators, 
double click on ExperimentalDisease.standard <br>
The new disease will be visible in the resource set. Expand the file node an you 
should see &#8220;ExperimentalDisease model human&#8221;. <br>
Click on &#8220;ExperimentalDisease Disease model human&#8221; In the bottom window click on 
the properties tab to show the disease in the properties editor view. <br>
<br>
Click on the new infector icon (black square with the health symbol and the 
letter I)</p>

	</tr>
</table>
<p align="left"><br>
<br>
Name it (e.g., &quot;CubaInfector&quot;), under DiseaseName: &quot;ExperimentalDisease&quot;<br>
Under country select Cuba<br>
Click on the Scenario to open it in the Resource set<br>
drag the CubaInfector from Decorators into the scenario (open it to see it)<br>
<br>
In the resource set click on the infector SI Infector ExperimentalDisease to 
edit it. Your disease model may be SI, SIR, SIER, etc but in all cases you only 
need an SI infector (as this base class will add infectious people to seed any 
model.<br>
<br>
click on the scenario, right click and run </p>
