<h1>STEM Quick Start</h1>
<p>When you first start STEM it will display either the <a
	href="../interface/perspectives/designer.html">Designer perspective</a>
or the <a href="../interface/perspectives/simulation.html">Simulation
perspective</a>. Both contain the <a
	href="../interface/views/scenariosview.html">Scenarios view</a>. This
view contains a hierarchical display of the <a
	href="../concepts/modelingframework.html#scenario"> Scenarios</a> that
are built in to STEM and are ready to start a Simulation. See
Figures&nbsp;1 and 2 below.

<p>
<center><a
	href="../interface/perspectives/img/simulationperspective.jpg"><img
	src="../interface/perspectives/img/simulationperspective.jpg"></a></center>
<p>In either perspective, expand the tree displayed in the <a
	href="../interface/views/scenariosview.html">Scenarios view</a> to
display the available <a
	href="../concepts/modelingframework.html#scenario"> Scenarios</a>.
Select one of the displayed <a
	href="../concepts/modelingframework.html#scenario"> Scenarios</a> by
"double-clicking" on its title, Figure&nbsp;3.

<p>STEM will immediately switch to the <a
	href="../interface/perspectives/simulation.html">Simulation
perspective</a>, if it is not already displaying it, and begin reading in
the data that defines the Simulation. It's progress is displayed at the
bottom of the window. The amount of time it takes to read in the data
for the Simulation will depend upon the size of the model and the
characteristics of the host computer. On a fast computer with more than
2 gigabytes of RAM and fast disks the <a
	href="../concepts/modelingframework.html#scenario"> Scenario</a>
illustrated in Figure&nbsp;4, below, will load and began execution in
less than 30 seconds. On a smaller slower machine (e.g., a small laptop
with slow disks), this could take several minutes).</p>
<p>Note that the Simulation will begin execution before the <a
	href="../interface/views/mapview.html">Map view</a> will show any
activity. This is because the <a href="../interface/views/mapview.html">Map
view</a> doesn't begin reading the "map data" until it is known which
geographic areas are involved in the Simulation, which isn't known until
the Simulation is completely loaded and running. This isn't generally a
problem as the Simulation can be "reset" and re-started with the two in
sync.

In Figure&nbsp;5, below, various features of the display of a running
Simulation are highlighted. The "Map display control" is used to control
which features of the Simulation are displayed in the
<a href="../interface/views/mapview.html>Map view</a>
. The "Simulation control" area is used to "Start", "Pause", "Reset",
"Step" and "Stop" all the active Simulations. Similar controls (not
displayed) in the
<a href="../interface/views/controlview.html>Control view</a>
manage individual Simulation instances (STEM can run more than one
Simulation at a time). The highlighted area in the map shows the
geographic extend of the spread of the Spanish Influenza starting, in
this
<a href="../concepts/modelingframework.html#scenario"> Scenario</a>
, from Algeria.
