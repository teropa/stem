/**
 * This class is an example of how to run GUI code in Eclipse and monitor the
 * "selected" simulation, and how to extract the canonical graph from the
 * selected simulation and then extract data from it.
 * <p>
 * It creats an Eclipse "View" called "View Example1" that simply "dumps" the
 * latitude and longitude data extracted from the canonical graph to the view's
 * window. The example is simple, but it helps to understand how a JFace
 * "Viewer" (not the same as an Eclipse "View") works with content and label
 * providers.
 * <p>
 * There are three classes defined in this example. The first is the parent
 * class that is a <code>ViewPart</code> and implements what is seen in the
 * view's window in Eclipse. It contains a JFace <code>ListViewer</code> which
 * basically maintains a list of Objects and creates a display that prints a
 * descriptive text string for each one. The method
 * <code>createPartControl</code> is the code that initializes the SWT
 * graphics for the display of the view. It is passed an SWT
 * <code>Composite</code> instance called <code>parent</code> that is used
 * to "contain" the SWT/JFace elements of the view's that make up the display in
 * the view. The method does three things, it first creates the
 * <code>ListViewer</code> instance, giving the parent as an argument to the
 * constructer (this makes it part of the display), it then creates and passes
 * to the <code>ListViewer</code> the "Content" and "Label" providers it
 * needs. The Content and Label providers are the other two classes in this
 * example.
 * <p>
 * The content provider class is {@link ViewExample1ContentProvider}, while not
 * complex, it may not be obvious what's it's doing. It's job is to maintain the
 * contents of the <code>ListViewer</code>'s internal list of things to
 * display. It performs the "Controler" job in an "MVC" architecture. In our
 * example, the content provider is an {@link ISelectionListener} which means it
 * has a <code>selectionChanged</code> method. The idea behind the method is
 * that it is called whenever the user "selects" something in the Eclipse
 * interface. This doesn't happen automatically, an instance of the class must
 * be registered with the Eclipse "selection service" that serves as a central
 * dispatcher for selections. This registration is done in the
 * <code>createPartControl</code> method of the parent class. When something
 * is selected and the method is called, it must filter out the selections and
 * ignore those that are not instances of {@link ISimulation}. When it does
 * find a simulation instance, it removes the current contents of the list
 * maintained by the <code>ListViewer</code> and adds the newly selected
 * instances. It then tells the viewer to redraw itself.
 * <p>
 * The label provider class is {@link ViewExample1LabelProvider} and is the
 * easiest to understand, its is used by the <code>ListViewer</code> to
 * generate a text string for any of the <code>Objects</code> (i.e.,
 * <code>ISimulation</code> instances) it contains. The method
 * {@link ViewExample1LabelProvider#getText(Object)} does this and in this
 * example does the work to extract the latitude and longitude data from the
 * canonical graph used in the simulation. Then it just returns that data as a
 * (long) string to be displayed.
 * 
 * To see the example in action, you need to:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Run STEM</li>
 * <li> Open the "View Example 1" view.
 * "Window->Show&nbsp;View->Other->STEM->View&nbsp;Example&nbsp;1"</li>
 * <li> Open the "Active Simulations" view.
 * "Window->Show&nbsp;View->Active&nbsp;Simulations"</li>.
 * 
 * <li> Go to the "Scenarios" view. It shows the STEM Scenarios that are plugged
 * into STEM. </li>
 * <li> Expand "Test->Disease&nbsp;Models->Standard" and you'll see disease
 * modeling scenarios that are plugged into STEM. </li>
 * <li> Double-click on a scenario in the list (e.g., "SEIR 1 x 1") it will
 * begin simulation and an entry will appear in the "Active Simulations" view.
 * </li>
 * <li> Single click on the entry in the Active Simulations view. This will
 * select that simulation and the latitude/longitude data for that scenario will
 * appear in the View Example 1 view as a single (long) string. </li>
 * </ol>
 * If you double-click on another plugged-in Scenario so that two entries are
 * displayed in the Active Simulations view and the you select both, you'll see
 * two entries in the View Example 1 view, one for each of the selected
 * simulations.
 *
