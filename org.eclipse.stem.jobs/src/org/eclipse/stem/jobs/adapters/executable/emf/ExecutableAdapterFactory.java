	 * Basically, if you create an EMF model and define a
	 * {@link ExecutableAdapterFactory} for it so that the classes in that model
	 * can be adapted, you need to hook that factory into this one so that later
	 * when an attempt is made to adapt a class from that model is made the
	 * associated factory will be found. You can do that by adding the line:
	 * <code>
	 * ExecutableAdapterFactory.INSTANCE.addAdapterFactory(this);
	 * </code>
	 * to the default constructor of the new factory after the super call.
	 * You're not done however, you also have to "force" an instance of the
	 * class to be created so that the constructor is run. This is typically
	 * achieved by allocating an instance in the method
	 * {@link Activator#start(org.osgi.framework.BundleContext)}of the plug-in
	 * that defines the factory.

	 * collects together other {@link ComposeableAdapterFactory} adapter
	 * factories. Each class that implements {@link ExecutableAdapterFactory}
	 * needs to add itself to this instance with a call to
	 * {@link ComposedAdapterFactory#addAdapterFactory(org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.AdapterFactory)}.
	 * This will then allow adapters created by that factory to be found when
	 * adapting class instances handled by the new factory.
