ToDo
----

* Explore and document the performance profile of remote runs
* Reorganize the code to well-defined subprojects (especially get the server model out of core).

Changes made to existing code
-----------------------------

The following changes have been made to existing code to get CDO runs working. Most of them are quick hacks, and proper solutions to the underlying problems should be explored:

StandardPopulationModelImpl.handlePipeTransport() will call initPipeTransport() because the pipe transport maps are not EMF features and may have been initialized on the "other side".

decorator->graph relatiopnship changed from transient to non-transient (caused ClassCastException with CDO).
http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.tools.emf/msg23116.html

Commented out dependency to UI in FiniteDifferenceImpl.step(). Will have to find a way to get to the preferences without requiring UI.

SequentialSequencerImpl.getEndTime() tests if end time less than *or equal* to current time

Extracted Sceario.addDecoratorAdaptors() from init, so that the adaptors can be attached on the other side.
