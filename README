Changes
-------

StandardPopulationModelImpl.handlePipeTransport() will call initPipeTransport() because the pipe transport maps are not EMF features and may have been initialized on the "other side".

decorator->graph relatiopnship changed from transient to non-transient (caused ClassCastException with CDO).

Commented out dependency to UI FiniteDifferenceImpl.step(). Will have to find a way to get to the prefences without requiring UI.
