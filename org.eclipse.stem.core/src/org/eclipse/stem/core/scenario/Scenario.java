 * <p>
 * The {@link Model} contains the details of how to construct the
 * <em>canonical graph</em> (see {@link Graph}. This graph is what the
 * <code>Scenario</code> uses to represent the state of a simulation.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Sequencer} is used by the <code>Scenario</code> to determine the
 * sequence of points in time through which the <code>Scenario</code> will
 * {@link #step()} as it computes successive simulation states.
 * <p>
 * The "scenario decorators" implement that part of the simulation computation
 * that is specific to the <code>Scenario</code>.

 * A <code>Scenario</code> implements all of the logic necessary to sequence
 * through each step of a simulation and can be executed outside of the Eclipse
 * workbench.
