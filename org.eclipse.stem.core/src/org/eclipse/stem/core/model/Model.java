/**
 * A <code>Model</code> contains all of the components necessary to create a
 * canonical {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph} suitable for
 * simulation. In particular it contains a collection of
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph}'s and a collection of other
 * (sub) <code>Model</code>'s. This structure forms a "tree" with
 * <code>Model</code> instances as the tree's root and interior nodes, and
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph} instances as the tree's leaves.
 * <p>
 * Each <code>Model</code> can also contain collection's of {@link Decorator}'s
 * which can modify the canonical {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph}
 * when it is first created from the model (see {@link #getCanonicalGraph(URI)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.scenario.Scenario} contains a single
 * reference to a <code>Model</code>. That model is the root of the tree the
 * defines the canonical {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph} that will
 * be used for simulation. A {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.scenario.Scenario}
 * obtains the canonical {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph} from the
 * model by calling the method {@link #getCanonicalGraph(URI)}. This method
 * recursively creates the canonical
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph} by invoking itself on the
 * <code>Model</code> instances it contains. At each level of the recursion,
 * it combines the results of those calls with the
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph}'s it contains (if any). The
 * {@link Decorator}s in the model are also then allowed to modify (decorate)
 * the {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph}. Then, the recursion
 * attempts to resolve any outstanding unresolved links between
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Edge}s and
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Label}s and the
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Node}s in the canonical
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph} under construction. This is
 * accomplished by matching up the "target" {@link URI}s of the unresolved
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Edge}s or {@link Label}s with a
 * {@link URI} of a {@link Node}. Any which cannot be resolved are recorded
 * with a {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.UnresolvedIdentifiable}
 * instance (see
 * {@link org.eclipse.stem.core.graph.Graph#getUnresolvedIdentifiables()})
 * for later reporting.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface definition is also an "Annotated Java Interface" that defines
 * one class in a <a href="http://www.uml.org/">UML</a> "model". The UML class
 * diagram for the model is in the <code>documentation</code> folder of the
 * project. This file and the other interfaces in this Java package are
 * processed by the Eclipse Modeling Framework (aka EMF <a
 * href="http://org.eclipse/emf">http://org.eclipse/emf</a>). to automatically
 * generate an implementation of the model. EMF is documented in the book <a
 * href="http://www.awprofessional.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0131425420&rl=1">Eclipse
 * Modeling Framework </a> by Budinsky, et al.
