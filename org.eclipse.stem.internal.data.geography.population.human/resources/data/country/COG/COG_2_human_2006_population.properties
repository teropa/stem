# * Key Format: 
#
# * 
#
# * 	 For level 1 data, the key is the ISO3166-2 code. An ISO3166-2 code is composed as follows: 
#
# * a two letter country code followed by up to three alphanumeric characters for the level 1 administration.
#
# *
#
# * 	 For level 2 data, the key is the ISO3166-2 code followed by six digits. The leftmost two digits indicate
#
# * the level 1 container of a level 2 administration (i.e. California is a level 1 container for Orange County
#
# * which is a level 2 administration).  The two digits were taken from a lexicographic sorting of all the
#
# * level 1 administrations within a country. Similarly, the four leftmost digits indicate a level 2 administration.
#
# * Again, these four digits are an index into the lexicographic sorting of all level 2 administrations within 
#
# * a level 1 administration.
