Notes about the STEM - GoogleEarth interface
  org.eclipse.stem.ge
  
This file has notes that document interesting things relating to the STEM GoogleEarth interface code that should be preserved for future generation.

 Creating ANT build.xml  (in progress)
   rightclick plugin.xml ->PDE Tools -> Create Ant Build file

Change 
    <property name="javacSource" value="1.5"/>
	<property name="javacTarget" value="1.5"/>
	
 cd  C:\stem\org.eclipse.stem.ge
 ant zip.plugin 	
 
 Note the above is incomplete....

Running the GoogleEarth interface under STEM 
 
- Install and test GoogleEarth 
- update to the latest code and ensure it is refreshed and rebuilt
- Update the launch script to specify VM arguments   -Xmx512M 
- From Eclipse, Run Stem using stem.product
  
  In the new STEM workspace window   
   - Windows->Open Perspective->Simulation 
   - Windows->Show View->Other->Stem->GoogleEarth 
   - Windows->Preferences->GoogleEarth
      Specify any preferences that you want to use
   - Scenarios: select STEM->Spanish Flu
   - From the toolbar STEM icons, select "Advance"
   - Select GoogleEarth View window
   - Select the Simulation then right click for popup menu
   - select DisplayMap to send a map to GoogleEarth

Using SWT Program.launch(fn) 

This uses  the SWT Program utility class to launch the KML file to the GoogleEarth application.  
For some reason, although it compiles with no problem, at runtime it fails because it needs platform dependent JNI methods.  
On Windows it needs the dll file  
   swt-win32-3232.dll
   
After many fruitless attempts to get this to work I used the following hack to bypass the problem.
   Go to:
    http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.2-200606291905/index.php
   Download:    
    swt-3.2-win32-win32-x86.zip
   extract  
    swt-win32-3232.dll 
   put it in the root directory of the ge project. 
   It is then checked into SVN
   
This seems to work but would have to be slightly redone to support other platforms.

If someone figures out a better way to handle crossplatform support for SWT, please document it here.

 Embeded Web Server
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 See the following URL for information about using the web server 
 that is embeded in Eclipse.
   http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t62852.html?start=0
 
 We use this and it is started in StemKml.java
 
 There are special consideration to make the embedded web server run
 in a standalone Eclipse RCP.  The basic problem is that the embedded Tomcat server 
 cannot read from jar files and the default when exporting plugins from
 Eclipse is to package it in a jar.  
 A hack to bypass this is to do the following:
   - Modify build.properties so that "bin/" is included in
     the bin.includes statement.
   - Modify manifest.mf to include
      Bundle-ClassPath: bin/
Then run the export wizard from org.eclipse.stem.ui/stem.product

 There must be better ways to do this but at least 
 in 3.2.1, the above works.

 example.kml
 ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 File example.kml is an example of the KML that is generated by the Stem to GoogleEarth interface (actually this was from Stem 1 but should be the same of similar for Stem 2)

 Running on 2 processors with network attached files
 
   System1 
      STEM 
        Folder  netlink \\system1\c.tmp\ge
           
           
   System2 
         Folder c:/tmp/ge 
           Share c:\tmp as c.tmp
        Tomcat 
           
        GoogleEarth
        
        http://system1:8080/slideshow.html 
        
        cd %CATALINA_HOME%
        bin\tomcat5.exe
        
    An XP service cannot read network files so you have 
    to start Tomcat as a normal application if Tomcat is on the system
    that reads the network file.  Probably best thing to do is 
    run Tomcat and GE on the system that has the native files and let 
    STEM write to the network attached directory.
