	 * <p>
	 * This instance is a {@link ComposedAdapterFactory} which means that it
	 * collects together other {@link ComposeableAdapterFactory} adapter
	 * factories. Each class that implements
	 * {@link RelativeValueColorProviderAdapterFactory} needs to add itself to this
	 * instance with a call to
	 * {@link ComposedAdapterFactory#addAdapterFactory(org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.AdapterFactory)}.
	 * This will then allow adapters created by that factory to be found when
	 * adapting class instances handled by the new factory.
	 * <p>
	 * Basically, if you create an EMF model and define a
	 * {@link RelativeValueColorProviderAdapterFactory} for it so that the classes in
	 * that model can be adapted, you need to hook that factory into this one so
	 * that later when an attempt is made to adapt a class from that model is
	 * made the associated factory will be found. You can do that by adding the
	 * line: <code>
	 * RelativeValueColorProviderAdapterFactory.INSTANCE.addAdapterFactory(this);
	 * </code>
	 * to the default constructor of the new factory after the super call.
	 * You're not done however, you also have to "force" an instance of the
	 * class to be created so that the constructor is run. This is typically
	 * achieved by allocating an instance in the <code>start</code> method of
	 * the <code>Activator</code> of the plug-in that defines the factory.
